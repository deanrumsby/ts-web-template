# js-web-env

A ready-made development environment for working on web apps written in vanilla JavaScript.

With node.js and npm installed, just run:
`npm install` to get started.

To start the web server used for development, run:
`npm run dev`

And to create a production build, with minified CSS and JavaScript, run:
`npm run build`

The production build will be located in the /dist folder.
