# js-web-env

A development environment for working on web apps written in vanilla JavaScript.

Configured with the following tools:

- Webpack - with a dev server that allows hot loading of changes and that minifies the CSS and JavaScript used for production builds

- ESLint - configured with AirBnb's very popular ruleset

## Installation
With node.js and npm installed, just run:
`npm install` to get started.

To start the web server used for development, run:
`npm start`

And to create a production build, run:
`npm run build`

The production build will be located in the /dist folder.
